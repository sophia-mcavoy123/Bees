But, if we continue to treat bees the way that we are now, we will not have these foods on our tables due to pesticides being sprayed, and collony collapse disorder.<br> <a href= "https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/bees.pdf"> Read more here! </a> </td>
                <td> There are thousands of bee species. The honeybee: originally imported from Europe, raised and managed by beekeepers in order to make honey or to pollinate crops. It's an agricultural animal. Basically, a healthy environment needs bees â€” but not honeybees, Geldmann says. <br> <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/01/27/581007165/honeybees-help-farmers-but-they-dont-help-the-environment">Read more on NPR.</a></td>

        <p> As you can see from the table above, there are many different opinions on the need to save bees. While I do understand this, I still believe that bees are necessary for the outdoor environment. I have been lucky enough to be able to work with these lovely creatures. At my old school, my class took care of two hives and had the responsibility ourselves to take care of the hive, keep it clean, and make sure no animals or bugs got into the hive. I feel that this experience was critical to my understanding of the hive itself and how it works. If you yourself ever have the chance to do this, I highly recommend that you do so. All of the bees work together in harmony, and they all have two main goals in mind: making honey and reproducing more bees. The beauty that these bees create with out even know it is amazing. With your help, we can create a bee-utiful environment by doing one simple thing, spray no or pollinator friendly pesticides! Do you think that you can do this? <a href= "http://fafard.com/terrific-flowers-for-honey-bees/> "Click here to learn about flowers that honey bees like!" </a>
